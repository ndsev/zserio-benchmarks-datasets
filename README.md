# Zserio Datasets

Data sets for zserio benchmarks. This repository contains mocked data in JSON format needed to run
Zserio [benchmarks](https://github.com/ndsev/zserio/tree/master/benchmarks).

> Most of the datasets are created by [Mockaroo](https://mockaroo.com/).

Each folder contains a single dataset and a corresponding Mockaroo schema - e.g. `addressbook` contains
the dataset `addressbook.json` and it's schema `adressbook.schema.json`.
